- Maybe incorporate find and xargs in to the tree.

- Maybe incorporate bc and dc in to the tree.

- Maybe incorporate diffutils in to the tree (diff, diff3, sdiff).

- Update import-src.sh to be able to import new versions and overlay them
  in the source tree so the tree can try to keep up with upstream.
