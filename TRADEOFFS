Using bsdutils in place of GNU coreutils does come with some tradeoffs.  The
list below highlights some of these that you should consider before making the
switch:


Lack of long options
--------------------

This is a usability thing, but if you have a lot of scripts that use the long
options for GNU coreutils commands, you will have to change those to short
options with bsdutils.


No support for SELinux
----------------------

The ls(1) command from GNU coreutils can display SELinux information in file
listings.  Since this is Linux-specific, the bsdutils do not have support for
it.  If you don't need this or don't care about SELinux, then the bsdutils
should be functionally equivalent for you.


No translations
---------------

The bsdutils commands come with very simple untranslated help output and an
English language man page.  There may be translated man pages in the OpenBSD
source tree (we should look for those), but the commands themselves don't
output text in other languages.  However, text manipulation commands and things
like ls(1) do work with UTF-8 encodings and wide characters.
